    "**Meaning of the Difference:**\n",
    "The superior performance of DistilBERT compared to previous approaches stems from:\n",
    "1.  **Transfer Learning:** Unlike the other models that learned from scratch, DistilBERT started with a massive amount of pre-existing knowledge about English syntax and semantics (pre-trained on Wikipedia).\n",
    "2.  **Contextual Embeddings:** It understands that the meaning of a word changes based on its context (e.g., \"bank\" of a river vs. \"bank\" for money), whereas TF-IDF and standard embeddings are static.\n",
    "3.  **Self-Attention:** The Transformer architecture allows the model to weigh the importance of every word relative to every other word in the sentence simultaneously, capturing complex dependencies more effectively than the sequential processing of LSTMs or the local feature extraction of CNNs."

    "### (c) Comparison\n",
    "The Zero-shot AI model (Gemini) achieved an accuracy of **79.38%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Previous Approaches:**\n",
    "*   **Base Rate:** 59.38%\n",
    "*   **Naive Bayes:** 68.25%\n",
    "*   **MLP:** 71.75%\n",
    "*   **CNN:** 74.15%\n",
    "*   **LSTM:** 73.06%\n",
    "*   **DistilBERT (Fine-tuned):** 83.67%\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot Gemini:** 79.38%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "The Zero-shot Gemini model performed exceptionally well, outperforming all traditional supervised models (Naive Bayes, MLP, CNN, LSTM) without seeing a single training example from this dataset. It achieved nearly 80% accuracy purely based on its pre-trained knowledge of language and sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it did not beat the fine-tuned DistilBERT model (83.67%). This makes sense because DistilBERT was allowed to study the specific training data for this task, learning the exact vocabulary and style of these financial headlines (the \"specialist\" approach). Gemini, while a powerful \"generalist,\" had to guess the sentiment based on general principles without knowing the specific quirks of this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Off-the-shelf LLMs are incredibly powerful baselines that can beat complex custom models (like CNNs/LSTMs) with zero effort. However, for maximum performance, fine-tuning a smaller model (like DistilBERT) on domain-specific data is still the superior approach."
